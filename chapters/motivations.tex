\chapter{Introduction}

The existence of additional $U(1)$ gauge symmetries of nature are common in
several Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) theories \cite{goodsell2010, 
candelas1985, andreas2013, jaeckel2010}. Such theories envision the associated
gauge boson ($A'$, ``dark'', ``hidden'', ``heavy'' photon) inhabiting a 
``hidden sector''
consisting of a complex of particles and gauge bosons.  Probing the 
structure of such a hidden sector may be possible through several different portals
including ``kinetic mixing''.  In fact, it is natural for the $A'$ to 
kinematically mix with the Standard Model (SM) photon through the interaction
of massive fields carrying both SM hypercharge and dark charge \cite{holdom1986}.
The mixing of the photon with the $A'$ would not only allow searching for
new hidden sector particles, but also dark matter which some theoretical models
have envisioned as inhabiting the hidden sector, with it's interactions mediated
via an $A'$ \cite{arkani-hamed2009, pospelov2009, cheung2009, arkani-hamed2008}.

The chapter that follows will motivate the need to search for an $A'$.  
This will include an overview of the of the current astrophysical anomalies
that may be explained assuming a dark matter candidate whose interactions are 
mediated by a heavy photon.  Finally, a review of current experimental searches
for an $A'$ will be given.

\section{Theoretical Formalism and Physics Motivation}

As Holdom \cite{holdom1986} realized in the mid eighties, in a theory with 
$U(1)_Y \times U(1)'$, there is a term in the gauge part of the Lagrangian 
that allows $U(1)_Y$ and $U(1)'$ to mix.  The gauge part of such a theory can
be written as
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}_{\text{gauge}} = - \frac{1}{4} F_Y^{\mu \nu}F_{Y, \mu \nu}
                          - \frac{1}{4} F'^{\mu \nu}F'_{\mu \nu}
                          + \frac{1}{2} \epsilon F'^{\mu \nu} F_{Y, \mu \nu}
    \label{eqn:l_gauge}
\end{equation}
%the associated gauge boson (heavy photon,
%dark photon or $A'$) can couple to the SM photon through the ``kinetic mixing''
%interaction
where $F'_{\mu \nu} = \partial_{\mu}A'_{\nu} - \partial_{\nu}A'_{\mu}$ 
($F^{\mu \nu}_{Y} = \partial^{\mu}A^{\nu} - \partial^{\nu}A^{\mu}$) is the
field strength tensor of the heavy photon (SM hypercharge) and $\epsilon$ is a
dimensionless coupling constant.  Decoupling of the fields can be achieved by 
shifting the SM hypercharge gauge field as 
\begin{equation}
    A_{\mu} \rightarrow A_{\mu} - \epsilon A'_{\mu}.
\end{equation}
Dropping all $\epsilon^2$ terms, this results in the diagnolization of \ref{eqn:l_gauge} as
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}_{\text{gauge}} = - \frac{1}{4} F_Y^{\mu \nu}F_{Y, \mu \nu}
                          - \frac{1}{4} F'^{\mu \nu}F'_{\mu \nu}.
\end{equation}
However, the redefinition of the field also affects the interaction term of 
the Lagrangian, $\mathcal{L}_{int} = A^{\mu}J_{\mu}^{EM}$, which, in turn, induces
an effective coupling between the electromagnetic current and the heavy photon
field that is suppressed by a factor of $\epsilon$
\begin{equation}
    A^{\mu}J_{\mu}^{EM} \rightarrow (A^{\mu} - \epsilon A'^{\mu})J_{\mu}^{EM}
\end{equation}
As explained in chapter 2, this effective coupling can be exploited to search for heavy 
photons.

Mixing between the SM photon and the heavy photon can be naturally
generated at one-loop assuming there exist a massive particle, $\Phi$, that is charged
under both the SM hypercharge and dark charge (see Fig. \ref{fig:aprime_loop}).

\end{figure}
This generates values of $\epsilon \sim 10^{-8} - 10^{-2}$ 
\cite{arkani-hamed2008, bjorken2009}.  In some string theory constructions, 
values of epsilon as small as $\epsilon \sim 10^{-12}$ are expected \cite{}.

\section{Motivations for a Heavy Photon from Dark Matter}

Although the existence of dark matter (DM) has been firmly established through its
gravitational interaction \cite{popolo2014}, its exact nature continues to elude
us. An appealing
possibility is that DM inhabits a ``hidden sector'' with it's interactions 
mediated by an $A'$.  In turn, the kinetic mixing of the $A'$ with the SM 
photon may provide a portal that would allow the exploration of not only the 
properties of DM but the hidden sector itself.  Furthermore, several recently
observed astrophysical anomalies \cite{pamela2008, ackermann2012, aguilar2013}
may have a dark matter interpretation if it's
charge under an $A'$.  A summary of those anomalies along with their dark matter
interpretation will be presented here.

\subsection{Cosmic Rays}

Interest in hidden sector models surged in 2008 with the announcement by 
The Payload for Antimatter Matter Exploration and Light-nuclei Astrophysics \\ 
(PAMELA) of an unforeseen rise in the ratio of the cosmic ray (CR) positron flux
to CR electron flux, $e^{+}/(e^{+} + e^{-})$, above 10 GeV \cite{pamela2008}.
The rise was later confirmed by both the 
Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope \cite{ackermann2012} and Alpha Magnetic 
Spectrometer-02 \cite{aguilar2013} experiments and observed to continue
up to 200 GeV. 

The main source of CR positrons 
was expected to come from the interaction of CR nuclei with the interstellar 
medium (secondary production).  If such a production mechanism was dominant, 
cosmic ray propagation models predicted the fraction would fall with increasing
energy.  The observed rise lead to the speculation of additional sources of 
positrons including pulsars\cite{} and supernovas\cite{}.

One attractive scenario that could account for the rise was the annihilation of
DM.  Specifically, models where DM annihilates to leptons ($e^+e^-, \mu^+\mu^-$)
where found to fit the data fairly well, although, they
require very large annihilation rates \cite{cholis2009}. Alternatively, a 
more attractive model envisioned DM annihilating to a heavy photon which 
subsequently decays to 
$e^+e^-$ naturally leads to an enhancement in the annihilation cross-section
\cite{arkani-hamed2009}.  This model became less favorable as higher
precision measurements of the positron flux became available.  In fact, 
recent measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) have put very 
tight constraints on such a scenario.

\subsection{Light Dark Matter}

Recently, an analysis of three years of data collected by the Fermi Large Area
Telescope observed an extended emission in the spectrum of gamma-rays 
originating from the Galactic Center \cite{}.  Several models have been 
devised to try to explain the emission including the collision of energetic 
protons accelerated by a super-massive black hole \cite{}, pulsars \cite{} and
dark matter annihilation to leptons or hadron \cite{}.  The emission can also
be explained in the context of dark matter annihilation to an $A'$ which 
subsequently decays to SM particles.  Such a model requires a dark matter 
candidate of mass $\sim$ 10 GeV and heavy photons with a mass in the range 
of $\sim$ 100 MeV. 

Another anomalies that can be explained in the context of a light dark matter
candidate whose interactions are mediated by a heavy photon is the observance
of a 3.5 keV emission line from a cluster of galaxies \cite{}.  In this case, 
dark matter is assumed to self-interact producing an excited state.  The excited
state then decays to it's unexcited state a photon with an energy equal to 3.5 keV.
Again, this requires a $\sim$ GeV dark matter and a $\sim$ GeV mediator.

\section{Current Limits on Heavy Photons}

\subsection{Electron Beam Dump Experiments}

Electron beam dump experiments make use of a high intensity beam ``dumped'' onto
a thick ($\sim$ cm) target to produce highly boosted neutral particles through a 
process analogous to photon bremsstrahlung.  In order to suppress the large
SM backgrounds produced at the target, a shield of thickness $\sim$ cm - m
is placed immediately downstream and in front of the detector.
% What backgrounds are these experiments concerned with?
% What is the shield made of?
The thickness of the target and shield in combination with a high luminosity
beam allow such experiments to be sensitive to heavy photons with small 
couplings which tend to travel considerable distances before decaying.

Several electron beam dump experiments were devised over the last several decades with
the intention of searching for axions.  These included E137 \cite{bjorken1988}
and E141 \cite{riordan1987} conducted at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory,
E774 \cite{bross1991} at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, 
KEK \cite{konaka1986} in Japan and Orsay \cite{davier1989} in Frace. 
%The setup of each of the experiments is summarized on Table \ref{}. 
The results from each of these experiments have been reinterpreted in the 
context of a search for a heavy photon and used to set limits on the coupling
strength $\epsilon$ \cite{bjorken2009, andreas2012}.  The resulting limits are 
shown on Fig. \ref{fig:ap_limits}.

\subsection{Proton Beam Dump Experiments}

Proton beam dump experiments can also be used to search for heavy photons
through either the decay of mesons produced at the target or proton
bremsstrahlung.  The data collected by one such experiment that used the U70
accelerator at IHEP Serpukhov, was originally used to search for both axions
and a light Higgs boson.  The data was re-analyzed and a search for an $A'$ 
was conducted
using the $\pi_0 \rightarrow A'\gamma$ decay channel and proton bremmstrahlung
\cite{johannes2011, johannes2014}. The resulting limits are shown on Fig. 
\ref{fig:ap_limits}.

\subsection{Electron-Positron Colliders}

The past decade saw the operation of several high-luminosity $e^+e^-$ colliders 
that were able to collect a lot of data at diffent center-of-mass energies.
These include KLOE running at the the DA$\Phi$NE $\phi$ factory and BaBar, 
the B-Factory running at PEP-II.
