    If a heavy photon does indeed exist and has a mass that is within the 
    acceptance of HPS, it will appear as a resonance above the copious QED 
    trident invariant mass spectrum.  A search for such a resonance can be 
    performed by scanning the previously described invariant mass distribution
    for any significant peaks.  In the chapter that follows, the procedure used
    to search for such resonances will be discussed.

\section{Pseudo Data Sets}

Pseudo data sets are needed to study the fitter systematics and to optimize both
the fit function and window.  In order to obtain an invariant mass probability
density function (PDF) that describes the data, a smoothing algorithm was

applied to the normalized final invariant mass MC distribution.  The resulting
PDF after smoothing is shown on Fig. \ref{fig:smooth_pdf}. 

Events were sampled from the PDF between 0 and 100 MeV with the total number of

is binned to match the data distributions with the expectation value of each 
bin Poisson distributed.
