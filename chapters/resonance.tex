The following chapter will discuss the details and results from a resonance 
search conducted on the 2015 engineering run data.  This includes a discussion
of the toy studies used to optimize the fitter along with the statistical 
formalism used to set a limit.  The chapter will conclude with a discussion 
of systematics.

\section{Searching for a Resonance}

If a heavy photon does indeed exist and has a mass that is within the acceptance
of the HPS detector, it will appear as a resonance above the copious QED trident
invariant mass distribution.  Since the $A'$ signal is unknown a priori, the 
$e^+e^-$ invariant mass is scanned for any significant peaks at a given mass 
hypothesis.  With this in mind, the invariant mass distribution measured by
HPS (see section 4 and Fig. \ref{fig:mass_distribution}) will serve as the 
starting point for this analyses.

\subsection{Maximum Likelihood Fit}

Customarily, a search for a resonance is perfomed by constructing a
window centered at the mass hypothesis of interest.  Within the window, $A'$ 
signal events are expected to appear as a Gaussian resonance, $\phi$, centered at
the mass hypothesis, $m_{A'}$ and with a width, $\sigma_{m_{A'}}$, equal to the
 measured mass resolution of
the experiment.  The distribution of background events within the same window
can be modeled by a polynomial, $p$ with coefficients $t_j$.  Estimating the 
signal yield, $\mu$, within
the window, as well the background normalization, $B_{total}$ and shape, can be
done by the method of maximum likelihood.  The theoretical formalism
used to do this will be outlined here but a detailed discussion can be found in
\cite{Cowan:2010js}.

Assume the events within the window are binned as $n = (n_{1}, ... n_{i})$.
Furthermore, assume say the center of a bin if given by $b_i$ and has a width
equal to $\epsilon$. 
The expectation value of the $i$th bin in the range is given by 
\begin{equation}
    E[n_i] = S_{i} + B_{i}
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
    S_{i} = \mu \int_{b_i - \epsilon/2}^{b_i + \epsilon/2} \phi(m_{e^+e^-} | m_{A'}, \sigma_{m_{A'}}) d (m_{e^+e^-})
\end{equation} 
\begin{equation}
    B_{i} = B_{total} \int_{b_i - \epsilon/2}^{b_i + \epsilon/2} poly(m_{e^+e^-} | t_{j}) d (m_{e^+e^-})
\end{equation}
Denoting the nuissance parameters as $\theta = (B_{total},  t_{j})$, and estimation
of $\mu$ and $\theta$ can be obtained by finding the parameters $\hat{\mu}$ and
$\hat{\theta}$ which maximize the Poisson likelihood function $\mathcal{L}$
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}(\mu, \theta) = \prod_{k=1}^{i} \frac{(S_{k} + B_{k})^{n_k}}{n_{k}!} e^{-(S_{k} + B_{k})}. 
\end{equation}
In the case where the invariant mass is scanned for a resonance, the poisson 
likelihood function is maximized and used to estimate the signal yield using a
range of $A'$ mass hypotheses. 

\subsection{Likelihood Ratio}

When searching for a resonance above a distribution of background, it is 
necessary to descriminate between two scenarios:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The background only or null hypothesis, $H_{0}: \mu = 0$.
    \item The signal+background hypothesis or alternative, $H_{1}: \mu > 0$.
\end{itemize}
Establishing whether the signal+background model is significantly different 
from the background only model is typically done using the profile likelihood
ratio
\begin{equation}
    \lambda(0) = \frac{\mathcal{L}(0, \hat{\hat{\theta}})}{\mathcal{L}(\hat{\mu}, \hat{\theta})}
    \label{eqn:likelihood_ratio}
\end{equation}
where $\hat{\hat{\theta}}$ is the conditional estimator for the background 
parameters obtained by maximizing the Poisson likelihood with the assumption
of no signal i.e. background only.  As can be seen from \ref{eqn:likelihood_ratio}, 
if the estimator of the signal yield, $\hat{mu}$ is compatible (incompatible) with the background
only hypothesis i.e. $\mu = 0$, the likelihood ratio will tend to 1 (0).

A more convinient test stastistic is the log likelihood ratio defined as
\begin{equation}
    q_0 = \begin{cases}
            -2 \ln \frac{\mathcal{L}(0, \hat{\hat{\theta}})}{\mathcal{L}(\hat{\mu}, \hat{\theta})} 
            & \hat{\mu} > 0 \\
             0  & \hat{\mu} < 0
        \end{cases}
\end{equation}
According to Wilk's theorem \cite{Wilks:1938dza}, in the large sample limit, the test statistic
$q_0$ is asymptotically $\chi^2$ distributed with degrees of freedom equal to the
difference in parameters between the two models being tested.  In our current case, 
the number of degrees of freedom is one, since the signal yield does not appear in
the background only model.

Quantifying how extreme the observation is, a p-value can be calculated as
\begin{equation}
    p = \int_{q_{0,obs}}^{\infty} f(q_{0} | 0) dq_{0}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Pseudo Data Sets}

Pseudo data sets are needed to understand fitting systematics and to optimize
both
the fit function and window size.  In order to obtain an invariant mass probability
density function (PDF) that describes the data, smoothing algorithm 353 QH 
\cite{Friedman:1974vj} was

applied the unit normalized final invariant mass MC distribution.  The resulting
PDF after smoothing (blue line) overlayed over the MC distribution it was generated 
from is shown on Fig. \ref{fig:smooth_pdf}.

pseudo data is binned to match the data distributions with the expectation
