\chapter{Conclusion}

A resonance search for an $A'$ with a mass ranging between 20 MeV and 60
MeV and decaying to an $e^+e^-$ pair was performed using the unblinded
portion of the 2015 HPS engineering run dataset. No significant excess above the 
trident QED invariant mass background was observed.  Preliminary, 90\% confidence level,
upper limits on the square of the coupling strength were set at the level of $10^{-5} - 10^{-4}$. 
These upper limits
do not take into account systematics which will be incorporated into the final 
analysis using the full engineering run dataset.  A resonance search using the 
full engineering run dataset is expected to be completed over the summer. 
Using the full dataset, the reach is expected to increase by a factor of 
4 down to $\epsilon^2 \sim 10^{-6}$.
