    \begin{acknowledgements}
        The completion of this dissertation was due in large part to the guidance
        and support that I received from my collegues on the Heavy Photon Search
        experiment.  Specifically, I want to thank John Jarros for taking the
        time to mentor me and instill in me valuable knowledge that I will
        continue to use in the future.  I would also like to thank Tim Nelson, 
        Per Hansson, Mathew Graham.

        My collegues at the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics were also
        crucial to me completing my dissertation.  Specifically, I would like to
        thank

        Without the support of my family, I wouldn't be the person I am today.
        Para mi madre and padre, ustedes han inculcado en m\'{i}  

        To my father and mother, you have instilled in me two qualities that 
        allowed me to suceed: always pursue my goals to the best of my ability
        and never give up no matter what the situation.
